# Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Robot-Project
Final group project for ENGR 162. I was the sole developer of the control algorithm while my teammates focused on physical robot design, construction, and documentation.

Quick summary of the robot's tasks:

Spearheaded the program development of a 6” by 10” autonomous robot (making use of 600+ lines of Python code) to navigate through a 20’ x 20’ maze containing numerous obstacles
- Utilized PID Control, three ultrasonic sensors, a gyroscope, an IMU, and an accelerometer
- Additional functions included path mapping and avoidance of magnetic and heat sources
